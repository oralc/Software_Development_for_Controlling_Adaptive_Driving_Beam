\begin{comment}
This section deals in particular with your contributions to the thesis and may be subdivided into the following points, if necessary:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Analysis of current situation
	\item Results of patent reviews
	\item Description of state-of-the-art technology
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Review of literature with direct connection
		\item Information on existing solutions for aspects of the problem
		\item Discussion of the relevance with respect to your work
		\item Demonstration of your expertise in the area
		\item Factual presentation preferred
		\item Not just a listing of facts!
	\end{itemize}
	\item Presentation of target specifications for the actual state
	\item Calculations
	\item Tables and diagrams
	\item Concept development
	\item Principle sketches and/or construction drawings
	\item Prototype development
	\item Problem solution and test results (especially your contributions towards the problem solution; presentation of results as detailed as necessary):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Analyses of initial situation and determination of approach to the problem
		\item Development of the concept and of the basic approach
		\item Detailed presentation of the development of solutions with all calculations, constructions, programme steps, tables and diagrams, \etc
	\end{itemize}
	\item Results, findings and innovation
	\item Evaluations, \etc
\end{itemize}	
The original ideas, innovations and technological developments must be explained and presented with appropriate detail.
